# Introduction to Multi-Tenant Architecture

Multi-tenant architecture is an essential concept in cloud computing and software as a service (SaaS) applications. 
It is designed to host multiple tenants — or customers — in a single instance of the software, with each tenant's data and configurations kept separate. 
This shared approach allows organizations to scale their operations more effectively, as they can serve many customers using the same infrastructure and resources, resulting in lower operational costs.

## Benefits of Multi-Tenant Architecture

1. **Cost-Efficiency**: By sharing resources among multiple tenants, companies can save on infrastructure, development, and maintenance costs.
2. **Scalability**: As new tenants join, the system can scale to accommodate their needs without requiring significant changes.
3. **Simplified Updates**: When updates or patches are necessary, they can be rolled out to all tenants simultaneously, ensuring everyone has access to the latest features and security enhancements.
4. **Customization**: While the core software remains the same for all tenants, it is possible to offer customization options that allow each tenant to tailor the application to their specific needs.

## Architectural Considerations

In a multi-tenant environment, careful consideration must be given to data isolation, security, and performance. 
Since multiple tenants share the same infrastructure, it is essential to ensure that each tenant can only access their own data and that the system performs well under the load of multiple users.

Multi-tenant architecture can be achieved through various approaches, including:

- **Separate Databases**: Each tenant has its own database, ensuring data isolation but at a higher infrastructure cost.
- **Shared Database, Separate Schemas**: Tenants share a database but have separate schemas, balancing data isolation and cost.
- **Shared Database, Shared Schema**: All tenants share the same database and schema, with each row tagged with a tenant identifier, optimizing cost efficiency at the risk of more complex data access controls.
